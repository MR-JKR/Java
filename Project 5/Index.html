            <h3>Our Objective</h3>
            <p>We have learnt about the classification of library material and schemes in the
                previous lessons. Classification provides notation to the library materials and their
                position in the shelves. Catalogue holds a key to the holding of any library.
                Cataloguing is basically the process of preparation of entries for a library catalogue.
                It tells us what material a library contains on a given subject and where it may be
                found in a library</p>
