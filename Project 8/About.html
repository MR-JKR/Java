            <p>A library is a place that stores and organizes knowledge in the form of books and other materials, and provides access to that information. Libraries can also help people develop reading habits and use information to their needs.</p>
            <p>catalogue functions as a finding tool to know what a library has. for cataloguing different kinds of documents guide cataloguers. catalogue but their functions are quite distinct and different. a library book selection, but they do not do what a library catalogue does.</p>
            <p>The task of recording the contents of libraries is more than an instinct or a compulsive tic exercised by librarians; it began as a way to broadcast to readers what is available among the stacks of materials. The tradition of open stacks of printed books is paradigmatic to modern American library users, but ancient libraries featured stacks of clay or pre-paper scrolls that resisted browsing. And even into the age of books and printed journals in the following twenty-one centuries, many private and public libraries did not allow their readers to browse the stacks. The librarian with a deep knowledge of the contents of the collection (and the collections of kindred institutions) was the guide to what the reader could borrow, and it was through an interview with the librarian that the contents of the collection were fully revealed. However, recorded catalogs were an invaluable tool for librarian and reader alike. The catalog provides a permanent record of the collection over time and changing library staff. So the recording of collections on clay, paper, and later, electronic media is more than an instinct; it has always been a valuable tool for creating a permanent memory and map of the collection.</p>
